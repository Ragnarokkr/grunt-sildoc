## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `<%= meta.gruntVersion %>`

If you haven't used [Grunt][grunt] before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started][getting-started] guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile][] as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install <%= meta.name %> --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('<%= meta.name %>');
```
